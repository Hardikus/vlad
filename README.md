# vlad

Vlad is an attempt at providing convenient and simple validations. Vlad is
purely functional and makes no assumptions about your data. It can be used for
validating html form data as just as well as it can be used to validate your
csv about cats.

## Usage

Once some more work has been done I intend to make vlad available through
clojars.
